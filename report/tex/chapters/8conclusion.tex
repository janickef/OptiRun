This thesis presents OptiRun; a platform for optimized test execution in
distributed environments. OptiRun consists of a controller and a web-based user
interface from which the tool can be operated.

OptiX, a mechanism intended for strategically allocating tests with resource
constraints to machines in the distributed system, was designed and
implemented as part of the thesis. The aim of OptiX is to minimize the overall
execution time of test sets. ORX was created as an alternative allocation
mechanism. It was built on OR-tools, and was implemented for benchmarking
purposes in the evaluation process of OptiX. During the experimental evaluation,
OptiX provided better results for all of the test sets.

OptiRun was created to support Altibox in the procedure of incorporating test
automation as a practice in the testing process of their online web service TV
Overalt.
