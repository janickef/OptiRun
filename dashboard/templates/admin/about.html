    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        OptiRun is a platform for optimized test execution of automated web tests in distributed environments. It is built
        upon technologies such as Selenium and Django, and aims to minimize the execution time of a test set based on the
        available test machines in the system. OptiRun consists of two main elements; a controller, which takes care of test
        allocation, execution and result reporting, and a web application where users can upload and manage test scripts,
        request test executions, view execution results and report failed test executions to the issue tracking system JIRA.
